# python-email-sender

A simple python automatic email sender.

Input your email, your receiver email, and your email password to send a Hello World message to them.

Note that your email has to enable access from less secure app in order for this python app to automatically send email.

I would recommend using a development account rather than your main account, as enabling less secure app will poses some security risks. If you could write an app that can access to your google account and automatically send emails, so could anyone. 

To enable access from less secure app, follow the instructions below:

1. Go to https://myaccount.google.com
